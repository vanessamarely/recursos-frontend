# HTTP

## HTTP Protocols

HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) is the foundation of data communication for the World Wide Web. It is an application layer protocol designed to transfer information between networked devices and includes a set of rules for formatting and transferring web page data.

## HTTP Methods

- **GET**: Requests data from a specified resource.
- **POST**: Submits data to be processed to a specified resource.
- **PUT**: Updates a specified resource.
- **DELETE**: Deletes a specified resource.
- **HEAD**: Same as GET but returns only HTTP headers and no document body.
- **OPTIONS**: Returns the HTTP methods that the server supports.
- **PATCH**: Applies partial modifications to a resource.

## HTTP Status Codes

- **1xx (Informational)**: The request was received, continuing process.
- **2xx (Successful)**: The request was successfully received, understood, and accepted.
- **3xx (Redirection)**: Further action needs to be taken in order to complete the request.
- **4xx (Client Error)**: The request contains bad syntax or cannot be fulfilled.
- **5xx (Server Error)**: The server failed to fulfill an apparently valid request.

## HTTP Security

- **HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure)**: An extension of HTTP that is used for secure communication over a computer network, widely used on the Internet. It provides a secure channel over an insecure network in a client-server model.
